# Cookle-Recipe-Search-engine
Custom recipe search engine for cooking

The main reason behind this project is to help individuals who are not familiar with cooking recipes or cooking in general by providing them recipes with a detailed step by step guide to execute them and a relevant cooking video to ensure the highest possibility of succeeding in cooking a recipe. The main intent of this project is to: 

•	Provide young people a media from which they can learn how to cook.

•	Provide recipes to the users according to the ingredients they got in their kitchen at that time.

•	Provide useful video material to instruct the users about various cooking techniques (e.g. ways to cut vegetables, ways to cook an egg, etc.)
